# OpenAI API Spec Monitor

A GitHub Action that monitors the [OpenAI API Specification](https://app.stainless.com/api/spec/documented/openai/openapi.documented.yml) for changes. When a change is detected, the diff is analyzed using AI and a PR is created. The PR is automatically merged.

## Community

## How It Works

1.  Downloads the latest [OpenAI spec](https://app.stainless.com/api/spec/documented/openai/openapi.documented.yml).
2.  Compares the downloaded spec with the spec cached in the repository.
3.  If changes are detected, a summary is generated with AI based on the diff.
4.  A new PR is created using the generated summary.
5.  The PR is automatically merged.
